# docker-sextant

Sextant is a web-based system for the visualization and exploration of time-evolving linked geospatial data and the creation, sharing, and collaborative editing of `temporally-enriched' thematic maps which are produced by combining different sources of such data and other geospatial information available in standard OGC file formats (e.g., KML).

We have used SexTant in applications such as emergency response and land cover evolution (see the Demos section below). So, if you don't like the Google Crisis Response project, you can always use our tool. :)
